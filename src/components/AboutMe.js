          Hello! My name is Jason Burke, and I'm a programmer! I'm a big fan of
          movies and board games, so a number of my projects have some relation
          to those! Many are built to streamline the book-keeping for board
          games that I love.
        </p>

          I live in Chicago, and currently work in Medical Education. I work
          with students while they rotate on their Surgery Clerkship during
          their 3rd year of medical school.
        </p>

          In my spare time I run and compete in Warhammer events in the Chicago
          area. Blood Bowl and Warhammer Underworlds are my favorites, but I
          play other games as well! For these games you build and paint your own
          miniatures.
